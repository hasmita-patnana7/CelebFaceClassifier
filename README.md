### Sports Celebrity Image Classification Project

#### Project Overview

The Sports Celebrity Image Classification project aims to develop a system that can accurately identify sports celebrities from images. The project involves multiple stages including data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation.

#### Objectives

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collect a dataset of sports celebrity images.
   - Preprocess images using face and eye detection.
   - Apply wavelet transforms for feature extraction.

2. **Model Training**
   - Augment data to increase diversity and volume.
   - Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the preprocessed dataset.
   - Validate and test the model to ensure accuracy and robustness.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Use a confusion matrix to visualize and understand misclassifications.

4. **Deployment**
   - Develop a web application using a framework like Flask or Django.
   - Implement an inference pipeline for real-time predictions.
   - Design a user-friendly interface for image uploads and result display.

#### Key Steps and Techniques

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

- **Face and Eye Detection**
  - Use Haar cascades or similar techniques to detect faces and eyes in images.
  - Crop images to focus on the region of interest (the face).

- **Wavelet Transforms**
  - Apply wavelet transforms to extract features from the cropped images, enhancing relevant details for classification.

2. **Model Training**

- **Data Augmentation**
  - Apply techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting to increase the variability of the training data.

- **CNN Architecture**
  - Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) or custom architectures for training.
  - Train the model using the augmented dataset and validate its performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using the test set.
  
- **Confusion Matrix**
  - Generate a confusion matrix to identify and analyze misclassifications.

4. **Deployment**

- **Web Application Development**
  - Build a web application using Flask or Django.
  - Implement a pipeline for image uploads, preprocessing, and model inference.

- **User Interface Design**
  - Design an intuitive interface for users to upload images and view predictions.

#### Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to developing an image classification system for sports celebrities. By leveraging techniques like face detection, wavelet transforms, and CNNs, the project aims to create a robust and user-friendly tool for real-time sports celebrity identification.
